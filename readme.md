TIC TAC TOE

How to run:
node server.js
port: 3001

How it works now:
It should work in separated pages:
first tab - playerX
second tab - playerO 


Changes, must change: 
wrong behaviou when user close one part, another became o or when restart

AI logic for future:
provide setting saving: define what game type user choose
select o or x is preffarable
module/method to define optimal turn from bot side
